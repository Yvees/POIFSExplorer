We are very excited to create a standalone repo for this old/ancient tool in Nissl Lab. This tool exists for a long time although not many developers know it. It was located in tools/POIFS Browser folder. 

# POIFS Explorer

This is a tool originally created by [Huseyin Tufekcilerli](https://github.com/huseyint) in 2009. The previous name is POIFS Browser.

# What is POIFS Explorer

This is a tool to inspect any OLE2 Document compatible files (or ActiveX documents). 

## Interesting Old Story of this Tool
At the begining, I thought only NPOI team will use this tool to view the generated/existing OLE2 files. However, someone from PHP Excel team reaching me via email and say we also use this tool. Then I found there are more users than we originally thought.
